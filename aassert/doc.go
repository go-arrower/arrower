// Package aassert provides a set of testing tools
// for use with the normal Go testing system.
//
// Arrower encourages you to use the stretchr/testify/assert package.
// This package has additional arrower assertions that go beyond
// what testify is offering. assert is following the design decisions of
// testify/assert as close as possible.
